Backend: I have used spring boot starter project to create the backend API. Note that, I am a newbie to spring framework and I followed a youtube tutorial to complete the project. Don't forget to edit the CORS configuration to connect from the front-end (If you are not using port 4200 in the fronend).

Frontend: Angular was used and template from bootdey was used for GUI design.
